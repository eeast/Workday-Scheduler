# Challenge 5 - Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This website can be used as a simple schedule tracker for a typical work day. Events and tasks can be added to each line, and upon hitting the save icon, the event will be written to local memory, allowing the user to leave the page and come back to their same task items. This project was built with existing HMTL and CSS, and is meant to demonstrate an understanding of Third-Party APIs and DOM manipulation.
